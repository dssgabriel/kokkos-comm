Related Types
=============

.. cpp:namespace:: KokkosComm::mpi

.. _CommMode:

.. cpp:enum-class:: CommMode

    A scoped enum to specify the mode of an operation. Buffered mode is not supported.

    .. cpp:enumerator:: Standard

      The MPI implementation decides whether outgoing messages will be buffered. Send operations can be started whether or not a matching receive has been started. They may complete before a matching receive is started. Standard mode is non-local: successful completion of the send operation may depend on the occurrence of a matching receive.

    .. cpp:enumerator:: Ready

      Send operations may be started only if the matching receive is already started.

    .. cpp:enumerator:: Synchronous

      Synchronous mode: Send operations complete successfully only if a matching receive is started, and the receive operation has started to receive the message sent.

    .. cpp:enumerator:: Default

      Default mode is an alias for ``Standard`` mode, but lets users override the behavior of operations at compile-time using the ``KOKKOSCOMM_FORCE_SYNCHRONOUS_MODE`` pre-processor define. This forces ``Synchronous`` mode for all "default-mode" operations, which can be useful for debugging purposes, e.g. for asserting that the communication scheme is correct.
